This database was built for the analysis of pathogenic E. coli strains isolated from urine samples collected from companion animals with bacteriuria.

It contains E. coli virulence associated genes, including etsABC, cdtABC (I, II, III, IV and V), papG (I, II and III), uclD, entA, sinH, f17b-A, f17b-G, clbS, plasmid-borne ompT, hlyF and mig14, pdu operon, capsule (K1, K2, K5, K14, K100) genes, mcmA, and stx subtypes.
